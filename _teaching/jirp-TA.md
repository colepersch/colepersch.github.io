I served as a Teaching Faculty for the Juneau Icefield Research Program (JIRP) in the summer of 2022. JIRP is a field course designed to provide an interactive course in glaciology. I developed several lectures on historical glacial cycles, Milankovitch Theory, and general atmospheric circulation. In addition, I helped with hands-on workshops and co-led a book club about feminism and glaciology.
