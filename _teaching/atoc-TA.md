I served as an instructor for the Weather and Atmosphere Lab course for a total of four 4 sections (two per semester). My responsibilities included providing introductory lectures for each lab, assisting students with their weekly projects, and grading all lab reports. I was awarded the ATOC Graduate Student Lab TA award for my work in this role.
