I am a climate scientist interested in understanding the evolution of climate over time. I do so using climate models and equations. Right now, I am a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Colorado, Boulder studying in the Atmospheric and Ocean Sciences (ATOC) department.

Current Research
======
I am interested in understanding how orbital precession influences the global carbon cycle. Recently I submitted a paper that uses CESM  to compare air-sea carbon flux in the Southern Ocean under different states of precession.

Teaching
======
In addition to my scientific work, I am also passionate about teaching! I have had many chances to work as an instructor both in a traditional classroom setting and out in the field near Juneau, Alaska. My style is focused on engaging students to learn about science through discussion and critical thinking rather than route memorization. Through this experience, I am working on earning the Certificate in College Teaching offered by CU Boulder.

Past Work
======
While I was an undergraduate researcher at Hope College, I helped out with several experiments in nuclear physics at the [Facility for Rare Isotope Beams](https://frib.msu.edu/).
