I am a climate scientist interested in understanding the evolution of climate over time. I do so using climate models and equations. Right now, I am a Ph.D. candiate at the University of Colorado, Boulder studying in the Atmospheric and Ocean Sciences (ATOC) department.

Current Research
======
I am investigating how orbital precession infleucnes air-sea carbon flux in the Southern Ocean. Read more about it


Past Work
======
While I was an undergraduate researcher at Hope College, I helped out with several experiments in nuclear physics at the [Facility for Rare Isotope Beams](https://frib.msu.edu/).
